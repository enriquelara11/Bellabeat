### Scenario

Bellabeat has the opportunity to become a leader in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Oﬃcer of Bellabeat believe that by analyzing smart device we could unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I've been tasked to give the Bellabeat executive team with my analysis and a few high-level suggestions for Bellabeat's marketing plan.
