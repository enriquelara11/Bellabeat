# Bellabeat Data Analysis Case
*Presented by Enrique Lara*

## Introduction
Bellabeat is a high-tech maufacturer of health-focused products for women. Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat in 2013. Since then, it has experienced tremendous growth in popularity and has positioned itself as a tech-driven brand for women. The company creates some of the most beautifully crafted products for women that track many of their fitness trends. The company is able to collect activity on sleep, stress, and reproductive health which in turn have allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Currently, the company's items are offered through a growing number of retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising but is mostly focused on digital marketing which include investments in Google Search, active Facebook and Instagram accounts, and constantly engaging with customers on Twitter. The organization wants to use analytics to expand its marketing strategy further, which will be the subject of this research.

### Scenario
I am currently working as a junior data analyst for Bellabeat's marketing analyst team. Our goal is to analyze users trends in order to gain insight into how people are currently utilizing their smart devices. Bellabeat's cofounder and chief creative officer, Urka Sren, thinks that by examining smart devices, we might find new ways for the business to grow. I've been tasked to give the Bellabeat executive team  my analysis and a few high-level suggestions for Bellabeat's marketing plan. The information I find will help guide the future marketing strategy of the business.

### Our Stakeholders
- Marketing Analyst Team: My team, this is a group of data analysts that are in charge of gathering, evaluating, and driving Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
- Bellabeat ExecÅutive Team: Team who will decide whether to accept the marketing team's recommendations.

### Business Task
We seek to understand how people utilize the bellabeat devices differently by analyzing smart device usage from a sample of customers. Using the information from the study, we wish to suggest some new opportunities for the company's growth.
